# Super Awesome Movie Night

Super Awesome Movie Night will give the user a randomly selected movie at the click of a button

## Project Description

When the user wants to search a randomly selected movie, they enter our website and by clicking the button, a random ID generator will give the computer a random number to search a movie on TMDB's API, with which information the program will throw back at the user the selected movie's Title, poster, and a review that comes from a separate API.
